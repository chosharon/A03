     <h2>Glossaries</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Branch</li> - A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.

            <li>Clone</li> - A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.

            <li>Commit</li> - A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).

            <li>Fetch</li> - When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.

            <li>GIT</li> - Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.

            <li>Github</li> - Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration

            <li>Merge</li> - Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

            <li>Merge Conflict</li> - A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

            <li>Push</li> - To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.

            <li>Pull</li> - Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.

            <li>Remote</li> - This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

            <li>Repository</li> - A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
